## What is Machine Learnig?


ML definition:

1. Arthur Samuel:(older def)Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
  without being explicitly programmed

2. Tom Mitchell(Modern Def)Well-posed Learning problem:
  computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T
	and some performance measure P,
	if its performance on T , as measured by P,
	improves with experience E
  
  Let's see this in Playing checkers.
  
  E = the experience of playing many games of checkers  
  T = the task of playing checkers  
  P = the probability that the program will win the next game  
  
  so, computer program is learn from E to do T  
  and the program improves with performance measur P
	
## Machine learning algorithms:

there are two types of machine learning algorithms.
-> supervised learning
-> unsupervised learning

Others : Reinforcement learning, recommender systems
